Of all the illiterate adults in the world, two-thirds are women; extremely low literacy rates are concentrated in South and West Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (2010 est.).",

Giving access to an education that is beyond the standard, coupled with an irresistible vision and the spirit of social entrepreneurship drives the Epro 360 network. Tom Brokaw, a famous American TV journalist and agent for change, said, “It’s easy to make a bug. It’s hard to make a difference, and it’s so worth it.” This is why Epro 360 Gives evolved.",

Epro 360 believes that a fundamental education is a basic human right, which is why Epro 360 is working in collaboration with underprivileged communities. To achieve best results, Epro 360 maintains a partnership with the Indian teacher education platform ",

    "p4" => "Collaboration has become increasingly more important over the past years, because people have realized that one can accomplish more, when working together and building on one’s strengths. This is why Epro 360 believes in “giving an education for receiving an education.”",
    "p5" => "With the establishment of the Epro 360 Gives program, your study abroad experience with Epro 360 automatically contributes to another person’s education. This is exactly what today’s world needs: better education for more people. The belief that one has to outperform others, in order to step ahead, is toxic for the development of any society. Much human potential is lost in the midst of “getting better than everyone else,” that people lose track of what they actually want to accomplish.",
